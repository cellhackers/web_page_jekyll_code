excerpt: Originally from Toronto, Canada, I majored in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto. I then moved to Florida for graduate school in the lab of Vance Lemmon at the University of Miami. My PhD thesis focused on identifying transcriptional regulators that allow peripheral neurons, but not central neurons, to regenerate after injury. I came to California for a postdoc, working in the lab of Nadav Ahituv at UCSF to identify and dissect gene regulatory elements in vertebrate development as well as in human metabolism. In early 2013, I made the jump to <a href="https://www.23andme.com" rel="prefetch">23 and Me</a>, and have been working as a Scientist on the Product team.
