	  <div class="meta">PhD Candidate in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology</div>
	  <p>Matt is a 4th year graduate student in the Dr. Jason Rock's lab focusing on adult lung regeneration. The Cell Hackers club had its humble beginnings inside Matt's brain. He has been thrilled with its manifestation into reality. His interest in coding came about through both necessity and curiosity.</p>

          <div class="meta">PhD Candidate in Biomedical Sciences</div>
          <p>Melissa is a 3rd year BMS graduate student in Allan Balmain's lab, focusing on cancer genetics and the clonality and evolution of tumors. She was previously founder of and a developer at <a href="https://www.themuse.com/" rel="prefetch">The Muse</a>, where she taught herself to code, and is now excited to be applying those skills to computational biology.</p>

          <div class="meta">PhD Candidate in Biomedical Sciences</div>
          <p>Nicolas is a 4th year graduate student in Ryan Hernandez's lab. He is investigating the evolutionary interaction between a host's population of antibodies and infectious pathogens during an infection. To do this he is using ultra-deep sequencing of these two populations, and using Python and R to sift through the data.

          <div class="meta">PhD Candidate in Tetrad</div>
          <p>Bryne is a 4th year graduate student in Todd Nystul's lab studying stem cell biology with a focus on quantitative microscopy to measure pH inside of cells. She taught herself to code in R because she could make prettier graphs in R than in excel. She is excited about learning more R and Python.</p>
